# Valoreo Data Scientist Test

Valoreo's mission is contribute to grow e-commerce industry in Latam. So, in this test I propose a way to forecast in a weekly basis the best seller products based on historical sales between February 2017 to September 2018 from brazilian market Also, if you want to upgrade the price of a product, you could do it and upgrade the forecast.

At item 2, I found the products that return 80% of benefits to Valoreo, assuming that cost product is 70%. You will find the list of this products in 'pareto_products.csv' file. In addition, I propose a way to distribute a marketing budget based on profit by most profitable categories.

At item 3, I propose a way to group the sellers.
